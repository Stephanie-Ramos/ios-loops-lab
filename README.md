        break
    }
}
```
***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// Your explanation here
Infinite, because the condition will always be true and the user has not created a condition in the while loop. 
```

***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
```
answer:
```
swift
var i = 5
repeat {
    print(i)
    i += 1
} while i < 10
```

***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
```
answer:
```
swift
var i = 5
repeat {
    print(i)
    i += 1
} while i < 1005
```

***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
```
answer:
```
var i = 5
while (i < 1005) {
    i += 1
    if i % 2 == 0 {
        print(i)
    }
}
```

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10
```
answer:
```
No difference, the console log would print "i = 1" up to "i = 10" for both of the loops. 
```

# Bonus =)

***
## Question 1

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.

answer: 
```
swift
Break exits the loop, meanwhile continue loops the value back and continues on to the next value (essentially it ignores the value). 
```
***
## Question 2

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[x]1 
[x]2
[x]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[x]8
[x]9
[x]10

***
## Question 3

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[x]1
[x]2
[x]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[]8
[]9
[]10

***
## Question 4

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}
```
answer: 
```
swift 
x = 1, y = 1
x = 2, y = 1
x = 3, y = 1
// the continue outerloop acts like the break keyword. When y == 2, the values are entered into the outerloop for the print statement. 
```

***
## Question 5

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.

answer: 
```
swift
let points = [(0,0), (10, 0), (0, 10), (10, 10)]
print(points)
```
***
## Question 6

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 7

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 …).

Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift
1
4
9
16
25
```

***
## Question 8

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift

```

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.
